## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version, I:

+ Omitted the redundant "Utilities/Tools for" at the start of my title and 
  description.

+ Reduced the length of the title to less than 65 characters.

+ Only wrote package names, software names and API (application programming 
  interface) names in single quotes in title and description and omitted them 
  otherwise.

+ Added references describing the methods in my package in the description 
  field of my DESCRIPTION file in the form authors (year) <doi:...>
