\title{Calculate indices from the bands of a raster}
\usage{
calculate_indices(raster, indices, output_filename, ..., names_suffix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster}{The raster (either as a SpatRaster or object readable by
\code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}}) to compute indices from.}

\item{indices}{A data frame of indices to compute. The intent is for this
function to work with subsets of \link{spectral_indices}, but any data frame with
columns \code{formula} (containing a string representation of the equation used
to calculate the index), \code{bands} (a list column containing character vectors
of the necessary bands) and \code{short_name} (which will be used as the band
name) will work.}

\item{output_filename}{The filename to write the computed metrics to.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[terra:predict]{terra::predict()}}.}

\item{names_suffix}{If not \code{NULL}, will be used (with \code{\link[=paste]{paste()}}) to add a
suffix to each of the band names returned.}
}
\value{
\code{output_filename}, unchanged.

\description{
This function computes any number of indices from an input raster via
\code{\link[terra:predict]{terra::predict()}}. By default, this function is designed to work with
subsets of \code{\link[=spectral_indices]{spectral_indices()}}, but it will work with any data frame with a
\code{formula}, \code{bands}, and \code{short_name} column.
}
\details{
Note that this function is running code from the \code{formula} column of the
spectral indices data frame, which is derived from a JSON file downloaded off
the internet. It's not impossible that an attacker could take advantage of
this to run arbitrary code on your computer. Make sure you inspect the
\code{formula} column to make sure there's nothing nasty hiding in any of the
formulas you're going to run, and consider using pre-saved indices tables or
\code{spectral_indices(download_indices = FALSE)} if using this in an unsupervised
workload.
